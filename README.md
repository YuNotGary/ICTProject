# ICTProject

Written by Jarrad Perusic, Jordan Winter & Liuyu Zhao.

This project is a python-written program that will allow the importing of spectroscopy data, so that it can be normalised, 
plotted on a graph, and then exported for future plotting.

# Installation
This program has been created to be portable for ease of use. After you have downloaded and unzipped this folder, this location 
will now become your root directory. You will now be able to double-click the .exe file in the directory to begin the program.

We recommend that you add a shortcut to your Desktop or Start Menu to this .exe to make finding this program even easier.

# Files
The root directory will contain the following files
- data.py
- plot.py
- README,md

# Paths
Your root directory will be wherever the .exe file is located.
You can choose your import path from within the program.
Your exported normalised data files will be exported to 'root\Export'. They will be named '{originalFileName}_normalised.txt'

# Importing Files
- To import a file, just select the 'Import' button in the program's GUI. From here you will see a window pop up. 
- In this window, select one or more files that you would like to import (must be .txt format)
- After you are happy that you have selected all the files that you need, now hit Import.
- You should now see those select files sitting in the first pane of the program.

# Normalising
- To normalise the files that you just imported, select them by ticking the checkbox of each of them.
- Now hit the Collate button.
- You should see these files now in the second pane of the program, ready and waiting to be plotted.

# Plotting
- To plot these normalised files, select which one you would like to plot, and hit the Plot button
- When you are done with viewing this graph, you can select another and repeat the process

# Exporting
- Your nomalised data files will be exported automatically after they have been run through the normalisation process. 
Check the 'root\Export' path to find them. They will be named '{originalFileName}_normalised.txt'
